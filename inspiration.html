   <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>1.</b> He stands alone, in quiet thought,<br>
      Above the streets, where days are caught.<br>
A soft pink shirt, the breeze’s touch,<br>
Moments pass, but don’t mean much.<br>
<br>
Gazing out with eyes unseen,<br>
At rooftops red and skies serene.<br>
Perhaps he dreams, perhaps he waits,<br>
While life moves fast beyond the gates.<br>
<br>
Barefooted stance on patterned stone,<br>
In city noise, yet all alone.<br>
A silent pause, a breath, a view—<br>
The world below, his soul anew.<br>
</p><br><br>

 <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>2.</b> In a quiet corner, calm and warm,<br>
Where colors and patterns softly swarm,<br> 
He sits at ease, in gentle light,<br>
Beneath a gaze serene and bright.<br>
<br>
The Buddha watches with knowing eyes,<br>
As stillness settles and moments rise.<br>
A book half-opened, a lamp’s warm glow,<br>
Hints of stories still left to know.<br>
<br>
Surrounded by blooms, by art, by peace,<br>
In this small world, all worries cease.<br>
Here he finds a quiet grace,<br>
A little haven, a resting place.</p><br><br>

 <p style="font-size: 14px;"><b>3.</b> In a sea of purple bloom,<br>
You stand, dispelling every gloom.<br>
A splash of pink so bold and bright,<br>
A beacon in the morning light.<br>
<br>
The flowers reach, as if to share<br>
The joy of sunlight in the air.<br>
Petals soft in lavender hues,<br>
Matching grace and subtle clues.<br>
<br>
With gentle hands and calm repose,<br>
You blend where nature softly grows.<br>
Amid the branches, bright and free,<br>
You are as vibrant as the tree.<br>
<br>
A moment held, serene and pure,<br>
Where beauty lingers, sweet and sure.<br>
In fields of color, lush and grand,<br>
Nature holds you in its hand.
